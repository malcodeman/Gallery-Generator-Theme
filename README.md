# Gallery Generator Theme
Simple instagram-like image gallery.

This theme was created for [Pygram](https://github.com/malcodeman/Pygram) - static gallery generator.

[Aspect ratio problem](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/) was solved with psuedo element tactic and [object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property.

Images can be scaled up or down but the aspect ratio will remain the same.
